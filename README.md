As a bioinformatician, I noticed a gap in our field. While we create computational tools to aid science, we have neglected creating computational tools to aid pseudoscience.

Shade aside, while the primary goal of this repository is to sharpen and refresh my Python and GitHub skills, life is fun with the assignment of significance and symbolism to arbitrary signs. I aim to make these scripts user-friendly in case someone out there does want to use these for spiritual practice or for fun.

## Current and Planned Functionalities

Currently available functionalities are in bold while planned functions are plain text.
* **Reduction** - See reduction.py.
* Gematria - definitely for Roman alphabet, hopefully for Hebrew alphabet, and maybe with magic squares (e.g., Square of Mars)
